# StackOverflow Project

 In this project, we have worked on developing REST API endpoints of various functionalities required for a stackoverflow website from scratch. 
 
 In order to observe the functionality of the endpoints, we have used the Swagger user interface and store the data in the PostgreSQL database. Also, the project is implemented using Java Persistence API (JPA).
